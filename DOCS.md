# A Twitter Thread on how Credit impacts Daily Life

0/
Have you eveer considered why credit is important? Here's a 🧵

1/
- **Leveraging Big Purchases**: Can't buy a home/car outright? Credit is your friend and allows you to borrow from your future self.

2/ 
- **Building Financial Credibility**: A solid credit score => better rates & terms for future loans/mortgages.

3/ 
- **Emergencies**: Unexpected expenses? Credit offers a safety net to cover emergency costs.

4/ **Rising Interest Rates** ⬆️
Whenever FED & ECB rise global rates, borrowing costs increase: as a result, fewer people can afford to borrow, resulting in a slowdown in the economy.

5/ 
- **Old Gen**: Previous generations were fortunate enough to lock in loans at lower rates and live in economic times of prosperity where credit was easily accessible.

6/ 
- **New Gen**: Millenials, Gen Z and above are experiencing higher borrowing costs in an already debt-heavy environment, leading to a reduced buying power.

7/ **Modern Economy**
Freelance, gig & contract work => unpredictable incomes. Credit assessment gets tricky. Same with nomadism that leads to a lack of credit history.

8/ **Conclusion**
Current economic climate requires a new understanding of credit's role. Both generations face unique challenges, underlining the need for adaptability & novel solutions to old problems. 📚💡
